This is an =Elm= fork of https://github.com/Gaafar/dev-fonts!

My fork aims to be a educational project where I can practise =Elm=
but also be an up-to-date site where you can find some cool dev fonts
and see previews with your favourite language or editor theme!

Of course the code initially will be kinda identical with the original project
but I'll try to build a different visual art!
